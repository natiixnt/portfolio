                    h2.mt-5.mb-4 About
                    p.lead.mb-4 I am a software engineer focused on GenAI, automation and backend development. I like building things that solve real problems for developers and business teams: RAG systems, internal tools, workflow automations and AI assistants that live inside the tools people already use.
                    p.lead.mb-4 I started running my own projects and working with clients while still in school, which forced me to learn fast and take responsibility for real systems early. Since then I have founded an AI based edtech product, built automations for service and real estate businesses, and delivered internal tools for NGOs and small teams.
                    p.lead.mb-4 On the technical side I work mainly with Python and Node.js on the backend, React and TypeScript on the frontend and cloud services like AWS and GCP. I integrate LLMs, vector databases and external APIs, but I also care a lot about data models, validation, error handling and observability. My favourite projects are the ones where I can own a piece of the platform end to end and iterate directly with users.
                    p.lead.mb-0 Right now I am looking for roles where I can combine software engineering, GenAI and automation, preferably in product teams that care about quality, data and long term impact.

                    p.lead.mb-3 I like working at the intersection of AI, automation and developer experience. I enjoy turning messy processes and data into clear systems, tools and workflows that save people time and mental energy.
                    p.lead.mb-0 Outside of work I train at the gym and play sports, follow what is happening in AI and software, and work on side projects that mix code, learning and social impact. I like environments where I can grow fast, share what I learn and ship things that are actually used.
